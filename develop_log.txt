ABOUT MBR:
	*When writing MBR file,the beginning of nasm code should be 07c0,because in the very first computer, the least required memory size is 32KB, the beginning is used by BIOS. 
	Therefore, to remain as more as possible continuous memory space to OS, mbr file is put at the end of 32KB memory space.

	*at the end of MBR file should be 55aa and I don't know why.
	
	*It turns out that you should implemented a proc call in nasm code and I don't know why.
