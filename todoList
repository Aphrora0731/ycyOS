1.set a stack segment in GDT(with selector=0x20)
2.pass parameters by stack to call C function

check

3.High address can't be re-written

check 
//intel saved some address which can't access

4.write keyboard driver.
	4.1
	   put common instruction of ISR into one function,calling paticular ISRby passing arguments.
	4.2
	   create a keyboard buffer in memory,where keyboard ISR put scan code,and C function read scan code


5.implement a better process schedule.
	4.1
		A list of process instead of a single int variable esp
	4.2
		Adress manage of process instead of force point to stack top

6.A bug result by struct array sys_page[SYS_PAGE_NUM],which takes about 1Mb to indexes whole memory space.For now I temporarily delete a member to save space 
and change the size of array so it won't take so much space but cant index the whole memory space.
